# Collatz Solver

I wrote this after seeing [Veritasium's video](youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg) on the problem, and thought it would be a good exercise.

If you run this long enough and prove the conjecture wrong, please credit me in whatever paper you write.

This requires [Boost](boost.org) to work, as it will deal with very large numbers and starts out with the largest number tried on the conjecture.
